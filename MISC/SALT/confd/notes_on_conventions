note on configuration conventions used in this directory
======

 - the "conf\.(minion|master).{conf_setting}\.\.human-label.conf" file name convention for configuration files is not standard for salt.
 - It's used because I feel it provides a higher degree of stability, recognition, and clarity when changing configuration.
 - It might be desirable to collect these discrete conf files in the "conf.d" directory, and include them via referring symlinks from within the corresponding config set (master or minion).
