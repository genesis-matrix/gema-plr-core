## NOTES on labels
##



{#
 - Labels are an abstraction of a heirarchy as key value pattern.
 - The first level is the key and everything following is the value.
 - For example, in the reference "label.service_feature.salt-master.infratest", the key is "service_feature", and the value is "salt-master.infratest".
 - You'll notice the "label" term is sometimes optional and is discarded from this classification when present.
